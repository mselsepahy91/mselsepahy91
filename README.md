**Figure 2**: Finite element analysis of retrofitted CES composite columns under varying loading conditions.

The model shown in **Figure 2** was developed using Abaqus software and highlights the stress distribution in the retrofitted columns. The results of this analysis provide insight into how different retrofitting techniques improve the structural performance of the columns.
